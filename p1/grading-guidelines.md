# Grading Process

## Timelines for Grading 
* The day after the regular deadline: grading process starts
* Three days after the hard deadline: TAs finish grading
* Within five days after the hard deadline: grades posted to Canvas and start collecting regrade requests
    * You can submit regrade requests through the [Project Grading Issues Form](https://forms.gle/uSp7bjHWwjqhkeYV7) 
    * The regrade requests are only for TA's mistakes in manual grading 
    * Please do not submit any regrade requests until grades are posted to Canvas 
* One week after the grade release on Canvas: we will stop collecting regrade requests
* One week after closing regrade requests for projects: TAs will contact you for regrade request results

## Other Notes
* TAs will only grade the **individual** portion 
* TAs can only make deductions on your autograder results
* TAs will state the reason(s) for deduction(s) with an inline comment
* TAs will also provide inline comment(s) about how to improve your code
